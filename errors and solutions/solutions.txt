1. Data Privacy Compliance
This implementation demonstrates column-level encryption using PostgreSQL's pgcrypto extension.

We create two functions: encrypt_data and decrypt_data.
These functions use pgcrypto's pgp_sym_encrypt and pgp_sym_decrypt for symmetric encryption.
In the customers table, sensitive fields (email and phone) are stored as BYTEA (binary) type to hold encrypted data.
When inserting data, we use the encrypt_data function to encrypt sensitive information.
When querying, we use the decrypt_data function to retrieve the original information.

This approach ensures that sensitive data is encrypted at rest in the database, providing an additional layer of security.
2. Handling Peak Load Times
This implementation provides a simple rate limiting function to manage high traffic periods.

We create a rate_limit table to track requests from each IP address.
The check_rate_limit function:

Inserts or updates the request count for an IP address.
Resets the count if the time window has passed.
Returns TRUE if the rate limit hasn't been exceeded, FALSE otherwise.


This function can be called before processing each request, allowing you to limit the number of requests from a single IP within a given time window.

While this is a basic implementation, it provides a foundation for more sophisticated rate limiting strategies.
3. Multi-tenancy Challenges
This solution demonstrates how to use Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation.

We create separate tenants and products tables.
RLS is enabled on the products table.
A policy is created that only allows access to a tenant's own products.
The set_current_tenant function is used to set the current tenant context.
When querying the products table, only rows belonging to the current tenant are visible.

This approach ensures that each tenant can only access their own data, even if they're all stored in the same table.
4. Real-time Inventory Management
This implementation shows how to use optimistic locking for inventory updates, which helps prevent race conditions in concurrent transactions.

The inventory table includes a version column.
The update_inventory function:

Attempts to update the inventory only if the current version matches the expected version.
Increments the version number with each successful update.
Returns TRUE if the update was successful, FALSE otherwise.


If two transactions try to update the same inventory item simultaneously, only one will succeed, and the other will need to retry with the new version number.

This approach helps maintain data consistency in high-concurrency scenarios without the performance overhead of pessimistic locking.
5. Database Version Control and Schema Evolution
While actual migration execution typically happens outside the database, this example shows how migration scripts for Flyway might look.

V1__Create_customers_table.sql creates the initial customers table.
V2__Add_customer_status.sql alters the table to add a new column.

Using a tool like Flyway allows for versioned, repeatable database migrations, making it easier to manage schema changes across different environments.
6. Cold Data Management
This implementation uses TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension for time-series data.

We create a regular table orders and convert it to a hypertable.
TimescaleDB automatically partitions this data by time, improving query performance.
We set up a retention policy to automatically remove data older than two years.
Queries on recent data (like the last month) will be much faster than on a regular table.

This approach is particularly useful for managing large volumes of time-series data, common in e-commerce for order history and analytics.
7. Handling Unstructured Data
This solution demonstrates using JSONB for flexible schema storage and querying.

We create a product_reviews table with a JSONB column for review data.
This allows storing varying structures of review data without changing the table schema.
We create a GIN index on the JSONB column for faster querying.
We also set up full-text search capabilities on the review text stored in the JSONB.

This approach provides flexibility for storing and querying complex, nested data structures that may vary between products or over time.
8. Maintaining Data Quality
This implementation shows how to use CHECK constraints and triggers for data validation.

We add a CHECK constraint to ensure email addresses match a specific format.
We create a trigger function to validate phone numbers before insert or update.
The trigger raises an exception if the phone number doesn't match the expected format.

These mechanisms help ensure data quality by enforcing business rules at the database level.
9. Managing Database Dependencies
This example demonstrates using schema namespaces to organize database objects.

We create separate schemas for inventory and sales.
Tables are created within these schemas, providing logical separation.
Foreign key relationships can still be established across schemas.

This approach helps in organizing a large number of database objects, making the overall structure more manageable and reducing naming conflicts.
10. Handling International Transactions
This implementation provides support for multi-currency transactions.

We create tables for currencies and exchange_rates.
The convert_currency function uses these tables to perform currency conversion.
It raises an exception if the required exchange rate is not found.

This setup allows for flexible handling of international transactions, with the ability to update exchange rates as needed.
