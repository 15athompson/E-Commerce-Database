Ecommerce Database Project
Project Title: Development and Implementation of an Advanced Ecommerce Database

Project Description:

In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema tailored for an ecommerce platform. The database was structured to manage various entities crucial for ecommerce operations, including customers, products, orders, order items, reviews, and inventory. The schema was designed to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and scalability, addressing the diverse needs of an ecommerce business. Key features of the project included the creation of advanced queries, stored procedures, triggers, and materialized views to optimize performance and provide robust data insights.

Key Components:

Database Schema:

Customers Table: Stores customer details with unique constraints on email.
Products Table: Manages product information including stock levels and pricing.
Orders Table: Captures order details with relationships to customers.
Order Items Table: Records individual items within an order.
Reviews Table: Allows customers to leave reviews for products.
Inventory Table: Tracks inventory levels and updates.
Advanced Queries:

Complex JOIN with Subquery and Window Function: Identified the top 5 customers by total order amount, including details of their most recent orders.
Recursive CTE: Calculated product category hierarchies, enabling deeper insights into product classifications.
Pivot Table using CASE Statements: Generated monthly sales summaries by category.
Window Functions for Inventory Analysis: Provided running totals and percentages of total inventory.
Full-Text Search: Implemented full-text search capabilities to improve product search functionality.
Materialized View: Cached complex query results to enhance performance.
Procedures and Triggers:

Stored Procedure for Processing Orders: Automated the process of order placement, including stock updates and order total calculations.
Trigger for Inventory Updates: Ensured inventory levels were updated in real-time following order item insertions.
User-Defined Functions:

Customer Lifetime Value Calculation: Created a function to estimate the lifetime value of a customer based on their purchase history.
Advanced Analytical Queries:

Monthly Sales Analysis with CTEs and Window Functions:
Combined multiple CTEs and window functions to provide an in-depth analysis of monthly sales, including sales growth and percentage of total monthly sales by category.
Identified top-performing product categories each month, aiding strategic decision-making.
Project Highlights:

Database Design: Developed a normalized database schema ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.
Performance Optimization: Utilized indexes, materialized views, and optimized queries to enhance database performance.
Data Analysis and Reporting: Implemented complex queries and analytical functions to provide actionable business insights.
Automation and Integrity: Designed stored procedures and triggers to automate processes and maintain data integrity.
Technologies Used:

Database Management System: PostgreSQL
Languages: SQL, PL/pgSQL
Tools: pgAdmin, DBeaver
